# Tech Debt Tracker

Keep this list small and actionable. Each item should have a concrete fix and a verification step.

| Item | Impact | Owner | Suggested fix | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (example) Reduce config drift | Agents build on stale docs |  | Add validation + update docs | `uv run scripts/validate_types.py` is green |
