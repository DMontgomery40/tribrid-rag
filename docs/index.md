# Repo Knowledge Base

This folder is the **repo-local system of record** for agent-facing knowledge. Keep it versioned, close to the code, and linked from `/Users/davidmontgomery/ragweld/AGENTS.md`. Prefer progressive disclosure: a small map at the entrypoint, with deeper details in focused pages.

## Naming (ragweld vs tribrid)

This repo/product is named **ragweld**. Many internal identifiers still say **tribrid**
(modules, config keys, docs titles). This is expected; do not mass-rename internal
`tribrid` naming.
