# Terminology & Naming Conventions

## Naming (ragweld vs tribrid)
- Repo = `ragweld`, internal identifiers = `tribrid`. This is expected.
- Do NOT attempt mass-renames of `tribrid` -> `ragweld`.

## Corpus vs Repo
- TriBridRAG is **corpus-first**: a corpus is any folder you index/search/GraphRAG over
- Code uses `repo_id` for the corpus identifier. Treat `repo_id` as `corpus_id`.
